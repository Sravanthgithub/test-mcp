# DSA Algorithms Documentation

This document provides an overview of the 10 different data structures and algorithms implemented in the `dsa` branch of this repository. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate Python file.

## List of Implemented Algorithms

1. **binary_search.py**
   - Implements the Binary Search algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array.
2. **bubble_sort.py**
   - Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm for sorting an array.
3. **merge_sort.py**
   - Implements the Merge Sort algorithm for efficient, stable sorting.
4. **quick_sort.py**
   - Implements the Quick Sort algorithm for fast, in-place sorting.
5. **dijkstra.py**
   - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
6. **fibonacci.py**
   - Generates the Fibonacci sequence using recursion or iteration.
7. **linked_list.py**
   - Provides a simple implementation of a singly linked list.
8. **stack.py**
   - Implements the Stack data structure with basic operations.
9. **queue.py**
   - Implements the Queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.
10. **binary_tree.py**
    - Provides a basic implementation of a binary tree and traversal algorithms.

## Usage

Each file can be run independently. Refer to comments within each file for usage examples and explanations.

Feel free to modify or extend these implementations as needed for your learning or project purposes.
